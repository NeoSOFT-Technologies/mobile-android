# mobile-android [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=NeoSOFT-Technologies_mobile-android&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=NeoSOFT-Technologies_mobile-android)

mobile-android is an application development framework - a toolkit - for people who build android apps using kotlin. 
Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. 

This lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task. 



## How to use ðŸ‘£

The app is no-frills, but sufficiently complex that you can use it as a template to build upon.

Just click on [![Use this template](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2a7da879baa8087a1b6b8cfbf8a82c29358f7a34e890d272a3053872be6c20a7/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f2d5573652532307468697325323074656d706c6174652d627269676874677265656e)](https://github.com/NeoSOFT-Technologies/mobile-android/generate) button to create a new repo starting from this template.

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution. 
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes. 
  * [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events. 
  * [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - Library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) 
  * [HILT](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides. Recommended by Android.
* Logging
  * [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
  * [OkHttp Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor)
* Database
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Store offline database
* Networking
  * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Light wight threads for asynchronous programming
* CI
  - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - Automatic PR verification including tests, linters and sonarqube analysis
* Gradle
  - [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)
* [Test](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/) - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests. Given When Then â€” Our Testing Approach
  * [Unit Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) ([JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) via [android-junit5](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5))
  * [UT Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing) ([Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso))
  * [Mockk](https://mockk.io/)



Common Features
-------------------

* Clean Architecture
* Adhering to SOLID Principles 
* Repository Pattern for code separations 
* Dependency Injection 
* Simple Network Layer 
* Simple Data Layer 
* Better Logging
* Automatic Error Handling 
* Media Selection Module  
* Generic Permission Handler
* Flavors Sample 
* Unit & Integration Tests 
* CI for build release 
* CD (TODO) 
* Use SonarQube Analysis & generate reports 
* Crashlytics/Analytics



## Gradle Setup 

This template is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are inside the *.kt files in the `buildSrc` folder. This provides convenient auto-completion when writing your gradle files.


## Documentation



* **MVVM - Model View ViewModel**

  * Robust, testable, and maintainable app with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.

  To learn more about the different architecture approach see, [Common Architecture Design Patterns](wiki/docs/discussion/COMMON_ANDROID_ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS.md) 

* [**Clean Architecture**](wiki/docs/modules/app-clean-arch-overview.md) for separation of concern & **modular approach**

* Every Activity/Fragment needs to extend BaseActivity/BaseFragment

* Every Activity will have a DataBinding object and ViewModel object defined in this way:

```KOTLIN
abstract class BaseActivity<B : ViewDataBinding, VM : BaseViewModel> : AppCompatActivity() {
```

```



#### Automated tests

Automated tests are usually placed into the `test` or, less commonly, into the `tests` folder.

> **Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under test?**
>
> **A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to test the *program*.
